Spotify-HypeMachine
===================

A test web app to display Hype Machine inside Spotify

Install
-------
Make sure Spotify is closed, then run these from a terminal:

```bash
# if you don't already have developer Spotify privileges, you'll need them to run this, I think
mkdir ~/Spotify
cd ~/Spotify
git clone https://github.com/KingMob/Spotify-HypeMachine.git
```

Then open Spotify, and in the search bar, enter `spotify:app:hypemachine`.
